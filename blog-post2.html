				   <p>When we are young, or when our cause is young, we feel so intensely—passion like our hormones runs strongest in youth—that it seems wrong to take it slow. This is just our impatience. This is our inability to see that burning our­selves out or blowing ourselves up isn’t going to hurry the journey along.</p>
			       <p>In life, we will face complex problems. These problems need skill, patience and understanding. In attempting to solve them, breathlessness and temperloss are poor substitutes for discipline, for mastery, for strength and purpose. What we really require in our ascent is purpose and realism. Purpose, you could say, is like passion with boundaries. Realism is detachment and perspective.</p>
				   <p>Because we only seem to hear about the passion of successful people, we forget that failures share the same trait. We don’t conceive of the consequences until we look at their trajectory</p>
				   <p>More than purpose, we also need realism. Where do we start? What do we do first? What do we do right now? How are we sure that what we’re doing is moving us forward? What are we benchmarking ourselves against?</p>
					<p>If passion is driven by energy and emotion, purpose is driven by reason. Ultimately, the latter is more likely to make us successful than the former.</p>

					<p>Diversity is usually experienced in movies as the crew and cast, members are from different parts of the country having different religions and accent. Despite of all these variations in them they still come together and showcase their spectacular talents within a limited timeframe of 3 hours, which leaves us with some or the other message and helps us to forget our little day to day worries and tensions.</p>
					<p>The songs provided by movies has been the soul to each one us. Any party, festival or a wedding is incomplete without a hip-hop or crazy tadka songs. For many of our society it is the music which accompanies them in times of their happiness or grief</p>
					<p>A coin has two sides likewise everything has its own pros and cons. Excess of anything is bad...</p>
					<p>Seeing the positive side, Movies are a major source of entertainment. From the moment we indulge in watching a movie we enter into a new world, forgetting all our worries and also our mind is at ease. Rich, poor, literate, illiterate, young or old all need something for relaxation. Recreation is an important part of each one’s life, thus watching a movie provides this avenue. </p>
					<p>A movie is a teamwork. It needs a director, actors, technicians, make-up artists etc. they collaborate with each other to make the movie a success and then its applauded by the audience as it shows the power of teamwork. It also leaves a message that teamwork pays off.</p>
					<p>Some blockbusters has always put a smile on everyone’s face. These are the movies that help people to revive from their day to day depressing lives. Laughter as being said the best medicine is distributed among the audience by them at a regular basis.</p>
					<p>If the actors are unideal heroes then they also have an unideal personalities. What the actors portray themselves on the screen is not actually what they are off screen. We as human beings are quite judgmental, we create an opinion about others whom we don’t know quite fast. As superstars are taken as most of ours role-models so in return they have a responsibility towards the society. We as fans think that our role models do not indulge in any of the evil acts but on the other side we get to hear about them as some of them are chain smokers, some are drug addicts etc. Basically they portray themselves the opposite of what they are on screen.</p>

				    <h2 class="mt-5 mb-3" id="remote">Remote working the new era in <b>software lifestyle</b></h2>
					<p>We are in the midst of a flexible workplace revolution and more employees than ever before are working remotely</p> 
					<p>The benefits of working from home are immediately clear for employees, namely avoiding the daily commute and working to a schedule that suits them</p>
				    <p>A reduction in the amount of time spent on a stressful and unpleasant commute is undoubtedly a benefit for employees, but it could also give your business a boost too.</p>
					<p>Working from home also reduces their travelling costs, which means your employees can spend more of their money of the things they love. The result is a happier, healthier and more motivated workforce.</p>
					<p>Some workers will prefer to the tidy office and spotless environment to be able to perform at their best. Other workers, perhaps those with a more creative bent, might do their best work curled up on the sofa or even late at night.</p>
